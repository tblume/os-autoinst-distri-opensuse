<h1>From Shakespeare's Hamlet</h1>

<p style="text-align: left;">I have of late but<br>
wherefore I know not lost all my mirth,<br>
forgone all custom of exercises;<br>
and indeed, it goes so heavily with<br>
my disposition that this goodly frame,<br>
the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory;<br>
this most excellent canopy, the air, look you,<br>
this brave o'erhanging firmament,<br>
this majestical roof fretted with golden fire<br>
why, it appeareth no other thing to me than a foul<br>
and pestilent congregation of vapours.<br>
What a piece of work is a man!<br>
how noble in reason! how infinite in faculties!<br>
in form and moving how express and admirable!<br>
in action how like an angel!<br>
in apprehension how like a god!<br>
the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals!
