<p class="author">by Wislawa Szymborska - 1972</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a tranquilizer.</p>

<p>I am effective at home,<br>
I work well at the office,<br>
I take exams,<br>
I appear in court,<br>
I carefully mend broken crockery -<br>
all you need do is take me,<br>
dissolve me under the tongue,<br>
all you need do is swallow me,<br>
just wash me down with water.</p>

<p>I know how to cope with misfortune,<br>
how to endure bad news,<br>
take the edge of injustice,<br>
make up for the absence of God,<br>
help pick out your widow's weeds.<br>
What are you waiting for -<br>
have faith in chemistry's compassion.</p>

<p>You're still a young man/woman,<br>
you really should settle down somehow.<br>
Who said<br>
life must be lived courageously?</p>

<p>Hand your abyss over to me -<br>
I will line it up with soft sleep,<br>
you'll be grateful for<br>
the four-footed landing.</p>

<p>Sell me your soul.<br>
There's no other buyer likely to turn up.</p>

<p>There's no other devil left.</p>
</blockquote>
