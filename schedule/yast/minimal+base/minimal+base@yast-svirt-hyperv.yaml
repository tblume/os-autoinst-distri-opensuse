description:    >
  Select a minimal textmode installation by starting with the default and unselecting all patterns
  except for "base" and "minimal". Not to be confused with the new system role "minimal" introduced with SLE15.
  It cannot access installation shell therefore it does not schedule module 'logs_from_installation_system'.
